# YouTube Playlist to Mp3 Downloader



I have a playlist on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB-0AGqg4hO99EoYUGyaR4H-1zBqN5wvi) named [Trademil Chart](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB-0AGqg4hO99EoYUGyaR4H-1zBqN5wvi) where I used to collect latest songs from YouTube. I use this playlist mostly during exercise. As there was 100+ songs I just needed the mp3 version of those songs, I could not get any free solution that will take a playlist as input and generate all the mp3 of that list.
</br>This is why, I created this project
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install pytube
```
Then open the yt_to_mp3_downloader.py script and edit according to your need
```
1. Enter the playlist URL first 
(Example: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB-0AGqg4hO99EoYUGyaR4H-1zBqN5wvi)

2. Enter the directory address where you want to save
(Ignore if you want to save it on current directory)
```

# Benefits
- Download a whole playlist of songs into mp3 in just one click
